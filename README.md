This project visualizes different algorithms adapted for creating mazes<br>
and solving them with various path finding algorithms.
</p>

> [!TIP]
>
> ### Check out the app at [amazeing.app/](https://amazeing.app/).

## Features

-   Implements 27 algorithms for maze creation and traversal.
-   Extensive control over algorithm execution (autoplay, iteration history, etc.).
-   Paintable grid graph for custom maze creation.
-   Easy import/export feature.
-   Statistics tracking during algorithm execution.
-   "Learn More" page with general info and additional resources.
-   Available as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Contributions / Support

Contributions are welcome! :heart:

**If you like what you see and just want to show some appreciation, you can do so on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ijeee).**

There are quite a few TODOs throughout this project, but I haven't created specific issues for them yet. Some of these tasks might be a good start for a first pull request, while others might be based on old information or poorly written notes.

Either way please create an issue first to avoid unnecessary work and to check if the feature/bug in question is
something that you can work on. PRs without any kind of discussion beforehand will almost certainly not be accepted.

When bugs related to the algorithms themselves are reported, they will always be prioritized over new features."

-   Please respect the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) for contributions.
-   This project also adheres to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
-   Code comments only when necessary but always for functions.

**Note:** The project is based on my other project which is quite boring
in comparison to be honest. Have a look [here](https://github.com/Ijee/Game-of-Life-Angular).

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for development. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running tests

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for e2e tests and ensures that
the most common use-cases are covered. More tests could be introduced but there is no way
to automatically test for the `correctness` of the algorithms themselves automatically.

Run locally: `npm run test:pw`
