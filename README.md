Code comments only when necessary but always for functions. There are quite a 
few TODOs in this project and I haven't come around to creating issues instead. Some of
them might be a good start for a first pull request. Please shoot me a message first
to avoid unnecessary work.

- This project also adheres to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
- Please respect the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) for contributions.


**Note:** The project is based on my other project which is quite boring
in comparison to be honest. Have a look [here](https://github.com/Ijee/Game-of-Life-Angular).
