title: Orthogonal Jump Point Search

The orthogonal jump point search is basically the same as the the normal [Jump Point Search](http://www.amazeing.app/learn?algorithm=Jump-PS) but restricts itself in the allowed movement directions to either be horizontal or vertical.

There's not much else to say about this variation at this point. I have yet to implement this algorithm variation but may end up incorporating it with the option flags on the Simulation page.
