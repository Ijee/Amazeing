# Assets

All the original assets are placed in here and only the web optimised ones based on the originals here are in the src/assets folder.

The same thing applies to the articles that can be found on the /learn page. The original markdown texts get converted to the appropriate json structure during the build process. See the build-articles.js script in the root project directory for more information.
The articles also have additional information in them that are in the frontmatter style. If you want to preview the changes that you made you have to rerun the build-articles script as I haven't come around to add a file watcher script.
